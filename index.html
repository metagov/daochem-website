<p><b>DAOchem</b> is a mixture of on- and off-chain governance data sources which react to 
produce a holistic view of DAO governance. We are working to integrate data on 
<b>smart contract parameters</b>, <b>voting activity</b>, <b>Twitter activity</b>, and 
<b>contributor sentiment</b> to help DAO creators, contributors and researchers understand 
the governance landscape.</p>

<p>
An overarching question driving our work is: are DAOs "working" right now? 
Are they what they say they are? Are they achieving their stated goals? How do DAO contributors 
feel about their experiences? To answer these questions, we're less interested in the 
nitty-gritty operational details specific to each DAO and more in patterns of governance 
structures and behaviors that might be observed across DAOs. In particular:
<ul>
  <li>What governance systems are DAO founders choosing to implement, with what "laws"?</li>
  <li>In what (measurable) ways are DAO members participating in governance? Does DAO member activity relate to the chosen systems?</li>
  <li>How satisfied are DAO members with their own experiences and with the health/success of the DAO overall? How do these experiences relate to the chosen systems?</li>
</ul>
We are creating new datasets from a variety of sources to help us investigate:
<ul>
  <li>The transaction histories of the "factory" smart contracts of governance frameworks like Aragon and DAOstack, and those of the DAO governance contracts they create</li>
  <li>Governance-related communications to the general public through Twitter </li>
  <li>A short survey to assess DAO contributor sentiment</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>This database and website is a work in progress! Currently, the database has the 
  following record counts:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Factories:</strong> 7</li>
  <li><strong>Factory transactions (roughly, daos created):</strong> 2463</li>
  <li><strong>Other transactions (roughly, dao activity):</strong> 15641</li>
  <li><strong>DAO Twitter accounts:</strong> 105</li>
  <li><strong>DAO tweets:</strong> 45170</li>
  <li><strong>Survey responses:</strong> 190</li>
</ul>
